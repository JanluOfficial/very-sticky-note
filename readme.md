# Very Sticky Note
A sticky note that is very sticky, and will always be on top.

## Why does this exist?
It was initially just intended to show off a feature request for [Fluid](https://fluid.so/), but then I decided to make it into a functioning application.

## Why would I need this?
Very Sticky Note is a great way to quickly write down things, such as URLs, Facts or code snippits. You can also open <code>.txt</code> files and save them as well, making it a nice alternative to opening notepad.
